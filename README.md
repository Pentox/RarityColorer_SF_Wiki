# Shadow Fight 3 Wiki Rarity Coloring Tool
Shadow fight 3 rarities should be colored for better understanding on the wiki. Fixing them one by one is not the ideal way to do it. For ease and convenience, I created this tool.
After pasting the source of a page/section in the box, the program will replace every occurance of words "common", "rare", "epic" and "legendary" with `<font color="YOUR_SELECTED_COLOR">Common/Rare/Epic/Legendary</font>` (case insensitive).
